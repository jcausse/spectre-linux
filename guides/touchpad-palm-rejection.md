## Touchpad Palm Rejection

Thanks to `aigilea` (see [this repo](https://github.com/aigilea/hp_spectre_x360_14_eu0xxx)).

Run the following command (copy and paste it in your terminal as if it was a single line). It will download the service file, copy it to the systemd directory, enable and start it, and finally remove the downloaded file.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcausse/spectre-linux/main/resources/palm-rejection.service -O palm-rejection.service && \
sudo cp palm-rejection.service /etc/systemd/system/ && \
sudo systemctl enable palm-rejection.service && \
sudo systemctl start palm-rejection.service && \
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
rm palm-rejection.service && \
systemctl status palm-rejection.service
```

On success, you should see something like:

```text
